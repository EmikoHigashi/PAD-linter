## Purpose

This repository collects real-world examples of **structural ambiguity, logical gaps, and misreading risks** found in publicly available documents (e.g., news articles).

The goal is **not criticism**, but **prevention**:
to study how documents can unintentionally invite misinterpretation by humans or AI systems, and how such risks can be reduced through better design.

This work is part of an ongoing effort toward:

- **Prevention through Design (Text Design)**
- AI-friendly documentation
- Human-in-the-loop–safe document structures

## What This Repository Is *Not*

- ❌ Not media criticism  
- ❌ Not fact-checking or judgment of correctness  
- ❌ Not evaluation of intent, ethics, or responsibility  
- ❌ Not targeting specific journalists or organizations  

All examples are used **solely as structural case studies**.

---

## What This Repository *Is*

- ✅ A collection of **document design failure modes**
- ✅ A taxonomy of **ambiguity patterns** (e.g., unclear collective scope, modifier attachment, causal gaps)
- ✅ A reference for **preventive writing practices**
- ✅ A design-oriented resource for engineers, researchers, and writers

## How to Read the Cases

Each case focuses on:

1. **Where misreading can occur**
2. **Why the structure allows it**
3. **What kind of reader or system is likely to misinterpret it**
4. **How the risk could be reduced by design**

Importantly:
> The presence of a case here does **not** imply that misreading actually occurred,
only that it **could plausibly occur**.

## Why Prevention Matters

In complex information environments:

- Readers bring different assumptions
- AI systems lack shared context
- Partial quotation and summarization are common

Even well-intentioned texts can become dangerous when:
- Context is stripped
- Sections are reused independently
- Implementation is triggered without full understanding

**Preventive design aims to reduce harm without restricting expression.**

---

## Intended Audience

- Engineers and system designers  
- Researchers working with AI or documentation  
- Educators and technical writers  
- Anyone interested in safe information design  

No prior expertise in linguistics is required.

## Contribution Policy

Contributions should:

- Focus on **structure**, not intent
- Avoid moral judgment
- Be reproducible from publicly accessible sources
- Clearly describe *why* a misreading is plausible

## Japanese Summary（日本語要約）

本リポジトリは、ニュース記事などの公開文書に見られる  
**「誤読が起こりうる構造」**を収集・分類するためのものです。

目的は批判ではなく、  
**誤読・誤用・暴走を未然に防ぐための文章設計（Prevention through Design）**の検討です。

個々の事例は、内容や意図の評価ではなく、  
「どのような構造が、どのような誤解を招きうるか」にのみ注目しています。
