# Case: Horse's Tail Prophecy

## Original Text
> "There's a kind of prophecy in Japan that because a horse's tail points downward, the market will drop," Iida said. "But I'm hearing that investors are hoping for an upward trend in the market despite this year's zodiac."

## Problem
- **Missing Context**: The text fails to mention that it is referring to a specific "horse statue" (at the Kabutocho shrine) before describing its tail.
- **Logical Leap**: It assumes the reader understands the cultural folklore linking a statue's physical posture to economic trends.
- **Ambiguity**: The connection between the "zodiac" (Year of the Horse) and the "physical tail direction" is not logically bridged, leaving the reader confused about whether this is about real horses, the zodiac, or a statue.

## Refactored Text
> "In Japanese market lore, the posture of certain horse statues is seen as a prophecy. Some believe that **since this statue's tail points downward, it symbolizes a downward trend in the market**," Iida said. "However, many investors remain optimistic, hoping for an upward trend despite the zodiac's traditional superstitions."

## Impact on AI/Reader
- **Human Reader**: Without the visual or cultural context of the statue, the statement feels like an irrational or disconnected remark.
- **AI**: May fail to identify the "horse" as a symbolic object (statue), potentially leading to a hallucinated interpretation of biological horse behavior affecting the economy.
